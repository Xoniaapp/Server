# server-node

Welcome to server-node, the work-in-progress backend for Xonia - a real-time chat application. This repository contains the server-side code that powers Xonia, enabling users to communicate with each other in real time. server-node is a powerful tool for building chat apps with the help of Node.js, and is designed to be easy to set up and use. Although server-node is still a work in progress, it already offers a wide range of features such as channels, direct messages, and more. We hope you'll join us in building the next generation of chat apps with server-node and be a part of the development of Xonia.

# Tech Stack

server-node is built with a powerful tech stack that includes PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma, Fastify, TypeScript, Node.js, WebSockets, and JWT.

PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store for server-node, providing a robust and reliable database that can handle high levels of concurrency.

Redis is used as a cache and message broker, improving the performance and scalability of server-node by reducing the load on the primary database.

Prisma is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that integrates with PostgreSQL and provides an easy-to-use API for interacting with the database.

Fastify is a fast and lightweight web framework for Node.js that is well-suited for building high-performance web servers.

TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language, improving the reliability and maintainability of server-node.

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for building scalable network applications, and is the platform on which server-node is built.

WebSockets are used to enable real-time communication between clients and the server-node server, allowing for fast and efficient messaging.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization in server-node, providing a secure way to identify and verify users."
